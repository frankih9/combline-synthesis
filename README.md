# Combline-Synthesis
Synthesis of combline bandpass filters based on Wenzel's paper.  
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1127609  
Z variable synthesis procedure is demonstrated in the python code and jupyter notebook.  
Wenzel's paper does not go into the details of the physical realization.  
Inclusion of physical realization procedure will be attempted in the future.
